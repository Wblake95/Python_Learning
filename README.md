# Python Learning
A dumping ground for stuff I'm trying in Python.

Goal is to create projects that I find.
1. Watch/read the tutorial
2. Understand what is happening and look up what is not explained
3. Build it to prove I understand it

Nice to haves
1. Be consistent with the code
2. Be pythonic
3. Write short and concise comments.
